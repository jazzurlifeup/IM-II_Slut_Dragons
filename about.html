                </h4>
                <p> Stefanie focused on enhancing the user experience through interactive features. She designed the
                    front-end interactions based on the data fetched by Jasmin. This included sorting, filtering and
                    dynamically displaying information based on user inputs.</p>

                </h4>
                <p> Jasmin handled the backend integration by fetching data from the API. She utilized JavaScript to
                    make asynchronous calls to the API, retrieve the data, and process it for further on the website.
                    She is also the talented artist who sketched those Dragons for our Profiles on the Website.

                <h4> “Don't talk to me before I've had something to eat. Actually - just don't talk to me.”</h4>
                <p> Anna-Maria was responsible for creating the visual design of the website using Figma. She translated
                    these Designs into actual code with CSS, ensuring the website matched the envisioned aesthetic and
                    functioned aesthetically on various devices.
